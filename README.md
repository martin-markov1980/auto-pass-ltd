**HTML,** **CSS** and **JavaScript** for a client who is a driving instructor in Manchester, UK.

## Motivation:
I got the **auto-pass-ltd** client through my first client **ace-drive** who has recommended me and introduce me to Moe and Zizi the owners of **auto-pass-ltd**
Similarly to the **ace-drive** project I wanted to build static site, hosted on github, so that my client can save some money and avoid paying for a hosting since the site is hosted at GitHub pages.<br>
At the same time he requested to have few forms on the site, who collect different data depending on the user needs.<br>
To avoid any extra backend logic and SMTP payed services I am using the service below:</br>
https://formsubmit.co/<br> 
which basically handle all the site form submissions and sends the results to the client email address.</br>
This service is quite good for low traffic sites, as it's provide 100 free form submissions per day.</br>
With this project I have also gain experience with setting **Domain Name** using Google domain names service and setting Cloudflare CDN for better site performance.

## Libraries, used in the site:
For the site layout and the css I used **bootstrap 5** - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/ <br>
